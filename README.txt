In this project we look at Mosssin's model. We start off by optimizing and finding the optimal insurance coverage for an insured agent to be linearly dependent on the his/her monetary loss. Then we find the set of optimal contracts for the agent and the insurance company to be as best off as possible. We then define a Monte Carlo function to show the agent expceted value for different values of pi and gamma. We find that the agent optimal choice would be the first option, with a gamma value of 0.9 and a pi value of 0.2 with an expected value of -0.28. Lastly we find the profit maximizing premium for the insurance company, using the Monte Carlo function to be 0.51.
